Simple Minecraft Plot Management

Player Manual
-------------

#### /nerdplot claim
Claim the plot you are standing in. You can only have so many plots for each type of area.

#### /nerdplot list
Name all the plots you are in. You can use worldguard /region commands to find out more about your plots (such as where they are).

#### /nerdplot info
Shows information about the plot you are standing in

#### /nerdplot tp <plot name> [<world name>]
Teleport to a plot

#### /nerdplot max
Shows the maximum number of plots you are allowed to have

Mod Manual
----------
####/nerdplot create <prefix> [\<parent\>]
Create a new region from your current WE selection. Prefix will be used as the region prefix and a numerical suffix will be automatically created. The optional parent parameter will automatically set the new plots parent region.

Example:
/nerdplot create suburb spawncity
And just spam the above command 100 times to get all suburbs!


#### /nerdplot remove -f <plot name>
Remove a plot from nerdplot tracking. If -f is omitted, a friendly warning will be printed.

#### /nerdplot info <plot name>
Shows information about the named plot

#### /nerdplot setowner \<playername\>
Add a player to a plot you are standing in. This bypassess the max plot check. The plot will still show up under /nerdplot listplots correctly.


Example:
/nerdplot setowner Challenger2
Adds Challenger2 to the plot you are standing in.

#### /nerdplot removeowner \<playername\>
Remove a plot owner from the plot you are standing in.
You can optionally specify the plot name if you do not want to stand in the plot.
Please do not use /region removeowner for this. The plot system will still count the plot towards the player's total plot count and will show up under /nerdplot listplots.

#### /nerdplot max \<max\>
Set the new maximum number of plots each player may have

#### /nerdplot list \<player\>
List all the plots a player has.

#### /nerdplot createarea \<areaname\>
Create a new area. Players can only claim so many plots within a given area.

#### /nerdplot removearea \<areaname\>
Remove an area. If a region is part of a delete area, no one will be able to claim it.

#### /nerdplot cleanup [-f]
Look for any regions that have been deleted or any regions a plot owner is no longer a member of. If any such inconsistencies are found, the player will be removed from /nerdplot so they wonâ€™t have rogue plots that are not really there (The plots would otherwise count towards their max plot count).
This command will run automatically on plugin load each server reboot.

#### /nerdplot version
Print version info

#### /plot thicken
Spawn Slime blocks somehow ?

#### /plot murder
lol?
